After the 2016 presidential election, We The Action (a nonprofit now part of Civic Nation) formed and partnered with Able to build a platform to do just that.\nNonprofits, often understaffed, don’t have the ability to effectively respond to offers to help, especially during times of social upheaval when hundreds want to get involved. On the other side of the equation, skilled volunteers often don’t know where they should go to help.\nWeTheAction.org\nlaunched in 2017, with the goal of making it easier for nonprofits to quickly structure projects and connect with legal volunteers, and for legal professionals to easily identify the pro bono opportunities that match their experience, interests, and schedule.\nSince then, activism in the US has evolved and become an essential part of everyday discourse. In response, we’ve innovated our platform to provide the power of scale, the simplicity of focus, and the network effect of multiple distributed teams working toward a common goal.\nThese tools have been used in key moments of activism.\nThe Supreme Court Dobbs Decision.\nWe The Action was built to respond to moments in history like this. The easy to use platform allowed us to quickly onboard new partners as we helped identify impactful ways for volunteer lawyers to ensure that access to safe and effective abortion care remains available to as many people as possible.\nThe Afghan Refugee Crisis.\nIn 2021 our platform powered the Welcome Legal Alliance's (WLA) effort to recruit lawyers and connect them with the nearly 80,000 Afghan refugees seeking legal assistance.\nThe 2020 Recount in Georgia.\nShortly after the polls closed on election night, we recruited over 250 lawyers to prepare for a recount in Georgia. Our platform helped lawyers see where they were needed, attend a training, and observe the vote tally in 40 counties around Georgia.\nOver the last five years, We The Action has built a community of over 43,000 lawyers and over 500 nonprofit partners.\nThe result is $112 million in pro bono legal work delivered toward American democracy’s most pressing issues, and counting.\nVisit We The Action\nUnlocking Growth and Empowering a Company Exit\nView Next Case Study\nLet’s\nbuild together.\nJoin our community of builders and innovators by subscribing to our monthly newsletter #TGIM\nLinkedIn\nPrivacy Policy\n©\n2025\nHome\nOur Work\nOur Offerings\nOur Team\nSocial Good\nContact Us\nLinkedIn\nPrivacy Policy\n©\n2025\nMenu"

We helped build an app for that.\nVisit\nGoogle Play Store\nApple Store\nServices offered\nProduct strategy, technical project management, React Native development, user experience audit and design\nOutcomes\n3x increase\nin TV and internet signup conversion rates\n4.5+ star ratings\nin the iOS and Android app stores\niOS and Android apps developed and released in\nunder three months\nBackground\nEstablished in 2010, Updater’s vision is to make moving a frictionless and delightful experience. They deliver this by helping users organize and complete moving-related tasks like booking movers, buying boxes, securing insurance, setting up services like utilities, TV, and internet, and more.\nUpdater hadn’t built a mobile app because its users weren’t demanding one – historically, Updater found that people weren’t willing to download an app for such a short period of time (while preparing for a move).\nBut, as the business grew and Updater began to tackle both pre- and post-move needs, the Updater team realized that their reliance on email, SMS, and mobile web could be better complemented with a mobile app. Updater approached Able to help craft and implement a new mobile strategy that would lay a strong foundation for the future and help them engage with users throughout the move journey in a modern way.\nOur strategy prioritized speed over feature expansion to capture revenue and better serve customers.\nBecause “moving season” takes place every summer in America and Updater reached out in early Spring, we knew that transitioning user behaviors to the app fast was the key to ensure continuous and increased revenue for moving season. Our strategy prioritized speed over feature expansion to capture revenue and better serve customers when they need Updater the most.\nOur development approach applied a hybrid app strategy, leveraging React Native, web wrappers, and web views to create the initial release in less than three months. After launch, we cycled through the app to replace wrappers with native components where we felt the impact justified the effort. We also conducted a thorough UX review and introduced a consistent design system using Updater’s design components.\nThe success of the initial release and UX enhancements have helped Updater triple its order rates for critical products within the app—a primary driver for their business. The dramatic impact of the work on their bottom line was the validation Updater needed to double-down on the future of their mobile app, and we are looking forward to building more incredible tech as partners.\nView On App Store\nDelivering Employee Benefits\nView Next Case Study\nLet’s\nbuild together.\nJoin our community of builders and innovators by subscribing to our monthly newsletter #TGIM\nLinkedIn\nPrivacy Policy\n©\n2025\nHome\nOur Work\nOur Offerings\nOur Team\nSocial Good\nContact Us\nLinkedIn\nPrivacy Policy\n©\n2025\nMenu"

UpTogether, a platform helping undervalued communities access capital, had operated for over 20 years with minimal focus on technical optimizations. Over time, we became their sole engineering partner, addressing platform-wide projects. In 2023, we conducted a thorough assessment of the software architecture to identify and resolve key system issues.\nAssessment Process\nThe assessment focused on both backend and frontend solutions, analyzing the breadth of existing Python microservices. Additionally, the AWS architecture, Lambdas, API Gateways, scheduled tasks, event handlers, and RDS instances were evaluated. The assessment relied on:\nInternal Engineering team interviews and follow-ups\nDeep dive into the existing documentation\nTechnical Audit of Systems\nFirst-hand knowledge and experiences from the Able team, having already worked on several areas\nThe assessment was completed by the Tech Lead and a part of the assigned team over the span of three months, as they kept working on new releases and other improvements in parallel.\nKey Findings\nWe provided several high-level recommendations to enhance system performance and streamline operations. We identified the need for modifications to existing services, such as implementing web-hooks and notifications, and advised the deletion of unused code while emphasizing the importance of following the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. Additionally, we suggested better utilization of AWS tools like Cloud Map for service discovery and management. Our recommendations also included adopting best practices for service versioning, dependency management, and security compliance. We conducted an in-depth evaluation of micro-services, highlighting both the benefits and the challenges, including increased operational complexity, data management issues, and communication overhead. As a simpler alternative, we proposed a modular monolith approach, which reduces complexity and streamlines operations. On the front end, we recommended framework updates to achieve a modern stack with less development overhead and advised reducing unnecessary dependencies to further improve efficiency.\nOur technical assessment services provide deep insights into your system's architecture and performance, offering tailored recommendations to enhance efficiency and scalability.\nOutput\nThe final delivery defined key findings and recommendations, including a detailed comparison of Microservices, Monolith, and Modular Monolith architectures, tailored for UpTogether. Additionally, a comprehensive architectural visualization of the entire system was provided to support the analysis and proposed solutions.\nStreamlining Value-Based Care Contracts\nView Next Case Study\nLet’s\nbuild together.\nJoin our community of builders and innovators by subscribing to our monthly newsletter #TGIM\nLinkedIn\nPrivacy Policy\n©\n2025\nHome\nOur Work\nOur Offerings\nOur Team\nSocial Good\nContact Us\nLinkedIn\nPrivacy Policy\n©\n2025\nMenu"
